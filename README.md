# seattle-911-md-gist
In this post, we'll explore an alternative universe, in which the city of Seattle receives 911 calls for only four reasons: an accident involving beavers, a seal attack, a Marshawn Lynch sighting, or a hot latte spills in someone's lap.

We're given a data set consisting of the 911 call logs. Our task is to learn from this data to predict the reason for any 911 call. We'll use the methods of data science to examine this data set and build a model to identify some of its underlying patterns. We'll test our model by making predictions and evaluating its performance.

Along the way, you'll encounter and absorb key concepts that are at the heart of the data science process. Ready? Come along, then. As Chris Cuomo would say: "Let's get after it!"
